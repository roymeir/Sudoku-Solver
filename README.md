# Sudoku-Solver
I really like sudoku puzzles. I was doing one today and noticed the repetitive nature of the task of solving it. 
That intrigued me and made me want to write code that solves the puzzle on its own.

The current state of this program is that once you run the code, you can choose a difficulty level that determines the number of empty spaces you'll have to fill out on the generated board. 
Once you choose the difficulty, the board is printed to the terminal for you to solve and a JPanel with a button opens.
When you wish, you can press the button to print the correct solution on the terminal and check your answer.

My next steps will be to move the entire game to the JPanel and let the user input numbers via their keyboard to the JPanel itself.
If the player gets a cell wrong, they'll be notified and recieve a strike. 
Three strikes means you lose the game.
Stay tuned!
