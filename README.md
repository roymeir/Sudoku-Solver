# Sudoku-Solver
I really like sudoku puzzles. I was doing one today and noticed the repetitive nature of the task of solving it. 
That intrigued me and made me want to write code that solves the puzzle on its own.
This is a Java program that takes a sudoku board as input and returns a solved board as output.
